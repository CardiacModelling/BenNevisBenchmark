# Notes for future work

- further adjustments to the plots to make them more suitable for presentation, e.g. better font size, figure size, and more lables or explanations
- run the algorithms with a larger number of iterations so that the measures really "converge"
- more algorithms to consider, including
  - topological search
  - particle swarm
  - variants of CMAES, like LR-CMA-ES or [IPOP-CMA-ES](https://sci2s.ugr.es/sites/default/files/files/TematicWebSites/EAMHCO/contributionsCEC05/auger05ARCMA.pdf)
- make a table of the performance of all algorithms
- hyper-parameter tuning using Bayesian optimization
- step-by-step visualization of algorithms in kml files (probably using animations) 
- make the problem dynamic by randomly selecting subregions. This could be useful to deterministic methods because now we can only run deterministic methods once (the result will always be the same). Also useful in preventing overfitting
